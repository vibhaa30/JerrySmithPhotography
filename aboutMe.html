    <p>Hi Iâ€™m Jerry Smith, an artist that takes social justice issues into account and spreads awareness through my collections. My parents were archaeologists so we traveled the world together. I witnessed the struggles of social classes,
      ethnicities,
      and cultures when stopping at different countries. Since I never got the chance to have a traditional school education, I spent most of my time discovering what I enjoyed doing. While doing so, my passion for photography and helping those in
      need
      began to grow. During my time in college I wanted to show my perspective on current social issues so I began formally studying photography. As time went on, I fell more in love with expressing others and myself through photography. <br><br>
      Now, this website allows people like you to view my different collections and educate yourself more on these topics. But you don't have to stop there! Book an appointment to discuss with me or, if you would like, be featured in my future
      photographs.</p>

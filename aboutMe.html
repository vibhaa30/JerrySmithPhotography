        </span>Jerry Smith, is an artist that takes social justice issues into account and spreads awareness through his collections. His parents were archaeologists so they traveled the world together. During these trips they would stop at various
        countries and he witnessed the struggles of social classes, ethnicities, and cultures. Since he never got the chance to have a traditional school education, he spent most of his time discovering what he really enjoyed doing. While doing so,
        his passion for photography and helping those in
        need began to grow. In his time at college he wanted to show his perspective on current social issues so he began formally studying photography. As time went on, he fell more in love with expressing others and himself through photography.

        </span>Jerry Smith is an artist that takes social justice issues into account and spreads awareness through his collections. His parents were archaeologists, they traveled the world together. During these trips they would stop at various
        countries and he witnessed the struggles of different social classes, ethnicities, and cultures. Since he never got the chance to have a traditional school education, he spent most of his time discovering what he really enjoyed. While doing so,
        his passion for photography and helping those in
        need began to grow. In his time at college he wanted to show his perspective on current social issues so he studied journalism, pursuing photography on the side. As time went on, he fell more in love with expressing others and himself through photography. Now he is an full-time photographer sharing his experiences with you.

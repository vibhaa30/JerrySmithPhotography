    <p>Hi Iâ€™m Jerry Smith, an artist that takes social justice issues into account and spreads awareness through my collections. My parents were archaeologists so we traveled the world together. I witnessed the struggles of social classes, ethnicities,
      and cultures when stopping at different countries. Since I never got the chance to have a traditional school education, I spent most of my time discovering what I enjoyed doing. While doing so, my passion for photography and helping those in need
      began to grow. During my time in college I wanted to show my perspective on current social issues so I began formally studying photography. As time went on, I fell more in love with expressing others and myself through photography. Now, this
      website allows people like you to view my different collections and educate yourself more on the topics. </p>
